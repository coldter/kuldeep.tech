In web development, full-stack gone through from buzzword to being **new norm** now. Every one trying to be one or looking for one. 


I always find the term very ambiguous (as everything else in tech ðŸ˜…) and when I asked, I get different answers depending on who Iâ€™m talking to, but generally they mean one of these two

- A  person who could understand/work and take **responsibility** of every component(in most case web/mobile/server-side logic/sometimes deployments) of an application/system.
- One who has broad **knowledge **of various components of a system, so one can collaborate with other stakeholders (other than one's current primarily objective) more effectively.

First definition, mostly given groups like freelancers, startups, and agencies and alike. These are the most consistent about their needs, they just want someone who can get over with what ever tasks in hand without much overhead. For this group, I can see the appeal for something like full-stack, as theyâ€™re mostly driven by two things in a market. One is _**how much someone is willing to pay for something**_, and the second is _**how quickly you can produce that thing**_. TBH, I find this kind of people very short-sighted and not much interested in ingenuity or scalability, so donâ€™t have much to way on this.


The second group claims that itâ€™s essential to have a very good understanding of various parts of a system to collaborate with each other, working on the system.
