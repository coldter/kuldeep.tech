There comes a another problem which platform to choose, As there are a tons and tons of solutions out there from billion CMS or headlessCMS and what not‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve some experience with could-hosted wordpress sites but it has far too many issues to be a viable self-hosted solution, both for speed and security reasons. I tried many thing from free not paid, most of theme were too overkill for my usage and other ones were straight up garbage or overprice for my usage, And I kinda don‚Äôt wanted to pay for something too small of a use case or something that I might just abandon in future. In some of the thing I tried I really liked Ghost and it‚Äôs simplicity and speed, and it‚Äôs open source which is a plus. But it‚Äôs too much of an hassle to setup and maintain and again I don‚Äôt want to pay for service. Hugo Logo There comes static site generators like hugo comes into the picture, there are many ssg out there like Jekyll, Eleventy with there own ecosystem of themes and development. I‚Äôve tried some of them and I have to say hugo is fasssttt you can generate pages at a blazing pace, with build times often under one second. And it has fairly large community around it, and I‚Äôm kinda go nerd now, so for me it‚Äôs a win-win. And most people I follow uses hugo for their blog, that way I can get little reference here and there from them. As I said, I just wanted that works and for me markdown is the way to go, SSG are perfect for this kind of use case. And all of the content of this site is open source and available on github.
