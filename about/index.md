## About Me

Hi, I'm Parmar Kuldeep, a profession software engineer with vast interests in cloud computing, security and automation. Proficient in many server-side languages and node.js ecosystem. Like to exploring various intersections of the fields as much as possible. Currently exploring generative AI and mlops.

This site is now place where all my notes mainly related to tech gets dumped. This is using my notion as primary source that syncs to hugo site source on [github](https://github.com/coldter/kuldeep.tech) using initial work of HEIGE-PCloud [Notion-Hugo](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/Notion-Hugo).

Something might broke due to invalid conversion of notion notes to markdown. Use original notion site for better experience. [https://kldp.notion.site/Public-Hugo-1bfe920b046e8063ad4adba71ea82a56](https://kldp.notion.site/Public-Hugo-1bfe920b046e8063ad4adba71ea82a56)
