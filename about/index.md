## About This Site

>"For me, blog is first of all a knowledge management tool, followed by a communication tool. All my articles are meant to be just a knowledge base for myself and maybe for others. I mainly write about thing I've not mastered or fully understand yet, so take my writing somewhat critically Showing off has never been my motivation."

The main topics here mostly would be cybersecurity, FOSS(Free Open Source Software), self-hosting and online privacy. Occasionally I might write about other things that may interest me.
