## About Me

Hi, I'm Parmar Kuldeep, and I like to go with coldter or kicksss online. I'm a bachelor in CS and IT from India. I write code for fun and, unfortunately, for a living as well. Furthermore, I like to explore anything and everything that piques my interests and always end up mesmerized by how vastly things are connected, along with some of their problems, and how divested yet resolute they can be. I consider myself a lone wolf, but I do understand the importance of teamwork.

Now, I don't like the term "H4cker" but like consider myself one, not for the skill, though (still have a loooooong way to go), but 'cuz I like to tinker with thing sometimes until I understand them, whether it's os, a piece of code, or a life object. And yeah! Sometimes I just give up because sh*t gets way too complex to fit in my brain.

## About This Site

>"For me, blog is first of all a knowledge management tool, followed by a communication tool. All my articles are meant to be just a knowledge base for myself and maybe for others. I mainly write about thing I've not mastered or fully understand yet, so take my writing somewhat critically Showing off has never been my motivation."

The main topics here would be cybersecurity, FOSS (Free Open Source Software), self-hosting, and online privacy. Occasionally, I might write about other things that may interest me.
