            </div>I like to try out new things and experiment with my systems quite a lot, and because of that, sometimes things break or don&rsquo;t quite work as expected. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a compatibility issue or because I messed up something. And that has sometimes cost me a lot of unnecessary effort and time.
I mostly never have to worry about most of my data, as I keep backups for most of it, or they are on cloud storage that I keep in sync with my local storage.]]></description></item><item><title>Ventoy: A Great Utility for Bootable Media</title><link>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/ventoy-a-great-util-for-bootable-media/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 02:23:49 +0530</pubDate><author><name>Kuldeep</name></author><guid>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/ventoy-a-great-util-for-bootable-media/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>I distro-hop quite a lot, sometimes to check out the new features of a distro and get a little feel for it, other times just to check the compatibility of different pieces of software. For these reasons, I might stay with a distribution for a long period of time or just for a few things here and there, but no matter the reason, I need to create a bootable media from the respected ISO files and burn them to a USB and so on, and I have to do it every time I want to change the distro for some reason I need a bootable media.</description></item><item><title>Build Cloudflare Pages Stack Weather App</title><link>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/hono-pages-stack-weatherapp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 14:29:17 +0530</pubDate><author><name>Kuldeep</name></author><guid>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/hono-pages-stack-weatherapp/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>It&rsquo;s been more than a year since I&rsquo;ve started working with typescript and the Node ecosystem, and throughout I have not written a single line of frontend code, Which I think is strange for some folks since I get asked about most things related to frontend, and they are surprised when I say I don&rsquo;t know ReAcT.
So I decided to change that and take a look at the frontend world.]]></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 02:09:09 +0530</pubDate><author><name>Kuldeep</name></author><guid>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/hello-world/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
