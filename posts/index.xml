            </div><p>I just want this post to be a short documentation of my current thoughts and perspectives as we rush towards 2024. As I&rsquo;m writing this, 2024 is just a few hours away. Can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s been four years since 2020 feels like yesterday and the fact that the year 2040 is nearer than the year 2000 the year of my birth.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Basic Backup With Clonezilla: Part-I(Backup)</title><link>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/basic-backup-with-clonezilla-part-ibackup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:06:59 +0530</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/basic-backup-with-clonezilla-part-ibackup/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>I like to try out new things and experiment with my systems quite a lot, and because of that, sometimes things break or don&rsquo;t quite work as expected. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a compatibility issue or because I messed up something. And that has sometimes cost me a lot of unnecessary effort and time.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Ventoy: A Great Utility for Bootable Media</title><link>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/ventoy-a-great-utility-for-bootable-media/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 02:23:49 +0530</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://kuldeep.tech/posts/ventoy-a-great-utility-for-bootable-media/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>I distro-hop quite a lot, sometimes to check out the new features of a distro and get a little feel for it, other times just to check the compatibility of different pieces of software.
