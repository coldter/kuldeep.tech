            </div><p>I just want this post to be a short documentation of my current thoughts and perspectives as we rush towards 2024. As I&rsquo;m writing this, 2024 is just a few hours away. Can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s been four years since 2020 feels like yesterday and the fact that the year 2040 is nearer than the year 2000 the year of my birth.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know what to think about these past few years, feels like too many things have changed and much going on, but at the same time does not feel like much happened at all.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
