            </div><p>It&rsquo;s been more than a year since I&rsquo;ve started working with typescript and the Node ecosystem, and throughout I have not written a single line of frontend code, Which I think is strange for some folks since I get asked about most things related to frontend, and they are surprised when I say I don&rsquo;t know <strong>ReAcT</strong>.</p>
<p>So I decided to change that and take a look at the frontend world. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in frontend and cosmetic stuff, but I do genuinely appreciate a good user experience and the thought process and craftsmanship that goes into making one. And what&rsquo;s a better way to understand something than to get your hands dirty with it?</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
